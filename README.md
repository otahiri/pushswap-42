# ttest_ai_algo
a typing test that has an ai to predict words you struggle with the most, it's basically the evil twin of monkeytype
so i wanna used to use a site called keybr.com so learn how to type but i noticed something it was lacking in difficulty,
so i decided why not make something like that on my own, a good learning project, and a good practicing tool i could use for typing to get better.

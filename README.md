_This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by otahiri-._
**Description**:
	this project aim to teach you to come up with a special algorithm under constraint, the main challenge is you only have 2 stacks and a set of operations you can apply on these stacks.
	the goal is to sort the first stack with as little operations as possible, you are forced to rely on the second stack to aid you in the sorting.
**Instructions**:
	to use this program you need to run the command "make" and you get a file called push_swap, you can run this program by typing the following command "./push_swap" and enter any numbers you want as long as they are integers which means they are no bigger than 2147483647 and no smaller than -2147483648,
	please keep in mind it will reject any number	bigger or smaller than these it will give you an error, it will also reject anything other than numbers.

	i will be honest here the chunk sorting algorithm was not my first pick i wanted to think i was smart enough to implement the turk sorting algorithm, i had a very bad time with it and it ultimately made me miserable, it got waay tooo complicated and it wasted a lot of my time, so i gave up, and tried the radix and honestly it was very easy but it never met the threshold so i went wit the chunk,
	i use the 2 articles above to make the radix and the turk, for the chunks i did find a good friend who explained it to me in a very to understand way, i was the perfect algorithm,
	but to be honest if i had to choose one to use in a real life scenario i will always use the radix, as it was the only one with consistent results and easily predictable.
	i did try to limit AI usage to the bare minimum, i used it for researching for new concepts or to explain complicated concepts,  and a bit of debugging. honestly, chatgpt is S-tier researching it is so convenient.
